    <h1> <strong>COMPUTER & CO. </strong>  </h1>
    <h2> <em>characteristics & attributes</em> </h2>
    <h3>characteristics of computers that have made them so powerful and universally useful are speed, accuracy, diligence, versatility and storage capacity.

    </h3>

    <p>SPEED -Computers work at an incredible speed. A powerful computer is capable of performing about 3-4 million simple instructions per second. <br></br>

        ACCURACY- In addition to being fast, computers are also accurate. Errors that may occur can almost always be attributed to human error (inaccurate data, poorly designed system or faulty instructions/programs written by the programmer)<br></br>
        
        DILIGENCE- Unlike human beings, computers are highly consistent. They do not suffer from human traits of boredom and tiredness resulting in lack of concentration. Computers, therefore, are better than human beings in performing voluminous and repetitive jobs.<br></br>
        VERSATILITY- Computers are versatile machines and are capable of performing any task as long as it can be broken down into a series of logical steps. The presence of computers can be seen in almost every sphere - Railway/Air reservation, Banks, Hotels, Weather forecasting and many more.<br></br>
        
        STORAGE CAPACITY- Today's computers can store large volumes of data. A piece of information once recorded (or stored) in the computer, can never be forgotten and can be retrieved almost instantaneously.<br></br>

        POWER OF REMEMBERING - Computer has the power of storing any amount of information or data. Any information can be stored and recalled as long as you require it, for any numbers of years. It depends entirely upon you how much data you want to store in a computer and when to lose or retrieve these data.<br></br>
        
        NO FEELING-It does not have feelings or emotion, taste, knowledge and experience. Thus it does not get tired even after long hours of work. It does not distinguish between <br></br>
        
        NO IQ- Computer  cannot do any work without instruction from the user. It performs the instructions at tremendous speed and with accuracy. It is you to decide what you want to do and in what sequence. So a computer cannot take its own decision as you can.<hr></hr>

    <h4> ATTRIBUTES</h4>
        <p> For example, eye color is an attribute of a person, while screen size is an attribute of a smartphone or TV. In computing and computer programming, an attribute is a changeable property or characteristic of some component of a program that can be set to different values.
        In computing, the term attribute is used in many different contexts. In the context of a file system, it refers to a characteristic of a file in that system. So, a particular file can have a read-only attribute, which means it is write protected and can't be changed. Another file may not have this attribute, so a person or an application can both read and write to it.</p>
